# Road_Accident_Analysis
🚗 Road Accident Analysis (2021–2022) — Data Analytics Project
Python | SQL | Power BI | Excel | EDA | Data Visualization

⭐ **Project Overview**

This project analyzes road accident data from 2021–2022 to uncover high-risk conditions, accident patterns, and contributing factors. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and supporting data-driven decision-making by government authorities and transport planners.

Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, this end-to-end analysis delivers validated KPIs, visual dashboards, and clear business recommendations.

🎯 **Business Problem**

Road accidents cause significant loss of life and economic damage.
Authorities need insights to:

Reduce accident frequency

Identify high-risk districts and vehicle types

Improve road infrastructure and lighting

Allocate resources efficiently

Implement targeted safety measures

This project provides those insights through an analytical and visual approach.

📊 **Key Objectives**

Analyze total accidents and casualties (2021–2022)

Validate all KPIs using SQL

Identify high-risk roads, vehicle categories, and time periods

Compare month-wise casualty trends

Examine environmental factors (weather, lighting, road type)

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

🧠** Top Insights**

Two-wheelers contribute the highest casualty share — major vulnerable group.

Night-time accidents have a significantly higher fatality rate than daytime accidents.

Urban areas report more accidents, but rural areas show higher severity.

Single carriageway roads account for the highest number of casualties.

Noticeable seasonal spikes during monsoon and festive months.
