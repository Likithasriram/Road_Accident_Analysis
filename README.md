⭐ **Project Overview**

This project analyzes road accident data from 2021–2022 to uncover high-risk conditions, accident patterns, and contributing factors. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and supporting data-driven decision-making by government authorities and transport planners.

Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, this end-to-end analysis delivers validated KPIs, visual dashboards, and clear business recommendations.

📁**Dataset Information**

The original dataset contains thousands of accident records with details such as severity, casualties, vehicle type, road type, weather, light conditions, and location.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, this repository includes a 900-row sample of the full dataset for demonstration purposes.

The complete dataset was used during analysis, EDA, SQL validation, and Power BI dashboard creation.

The sample uploaded here preserves the structure and key patterns of the original data.

🎯 **Business Problem**

Road accidents cause significant loss of life and economic damage.
Authorities need insights to:

Reduce accident frequency

Identify high-risk districts and vehicle types

Improve road infrastructure and lighting

Allocate resources efficiently

Implement targeted safety measures

This project provides those insights through an analytical and visual approach.

📊 **Key Objectives**

Analyze total accidents and casualties (2021–2022)

Validate all KPIs using SQL

Identify high-risk roads, vehicle categories, and time periods

Compare month-wise casualty trends

Examine environmental factors (weather, lighting, road type)

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

🧠 **Top Insights**

Two-wheelers contribute the highest casualty share — major vulnerable group.

Night-time accidents have a significantly higher fatality rate than daytime accidents.

Urban areas report more accidents, but rural areas show higher severity.

Single carriageway roads account for the highest number of casualties.

Noticeable seasonal spikes during monsoon and festive months.

🧪 **KPI Validation (SQL)**

All KPIs displayed in Power BI — including total accidents, total casualties, severity splits, monthly trends, and percentages — were independently validated using SQL queries.

This ensures that the dashboard metrics are:

Accurate

Consistent

Reliable for decision-making

🚀 🧪 **KPI Validation (SQL)**

All KPIs displayed in Power BI — including total accidents, total casualties, severity splits, monthly trends, and percentages — were independently validated using SQL queries.

This ensures that the dashboard metrics are:

Accurate

Consistent

Reliable for decision-making

🚀 **Business Impact**

This analysis helps authorities and policymakers:

Target road safety interventions more effectively

Prioritize infrastructure upgrades

Improve night-time visibility and lighting

Design campaigns for high-risk vehicle groups

Strengthen emergency response planning

By identifying high-risk factors, this project contributes to reducing accidents and saving lives.

🛣️ **Methodology Summary**

Data Cleaning — handled missing values, fixed date/time formats, standardized categories.

EDA (Python) — distributions, correlations, severity analysis, monthly trends.

SQL Validation — re-computed KPIs for accuracy.

Dashboarding (Power BI) — built interactive visuals for deeper insight.

Recommendations — actionable insights for safety improvement.

📌 **Recommendations**

Strengthen enforcement and safety programs for two-wheeler riders.

Install better lighting and reflective road markings in night-high-risk areas.

Improve emergency medical access in rural regions.

Upgrade single carriageway roads to safer designs.

Implement seasonal awareness campaigns during peak accident months.

🔮**Future Enhancements**

Predict accident hotspots using machine learning

Add geospatial heatmaps (GIS mapping)

Build real-time streaming dashboard

Develop severity prediction models
